# CorridorKey Runtime - Technical Specification

This document defines the current product scope, support philosophy, and
runtime architecture of CorridorKey Runtime. It answers what the product is,
why it exists, and what it explicitly includes and excludes.

## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 What This Is

CorridorKey Runtime is a native C++ runtime for the
[CorridorKey](https://github.com/nikopueringer/CorridorKey) neural green screen
model. It exists to eliminate the Python dependency from model execution and
to deliver a distributable, hardware-accelerated inference engine for
professional video production workflows.

The product currently provides three surfaces:

- An **OFX plugin** for DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke on Windows and macOS,
  backed by an out-of-process runtime service. The plugin is host-agnostic at
  the OFX 1.4 contract level; per-host workarounds (Resolve and Nuke 17 today)
  live in dedicated branches that never regress the path the other host
  depends on.
- A **CLI** (`corridorkey`) for direct command-line and pipeline use. The CLI
  ships inside the OFX installer and is registered on the system `PATH` at
  install time, so a single OFX install delivers both the OFX plugin and the
  CLI. The CLI is also available standalone in the portable runtime bundle.
- A **GUI** (Tauri-based desktop app) for users who prefer a graphical
  workflow over the CLI. The GUI is distributed as a separate desktop
  installer that embeds its own copy of the runtime payload; it is not bundled
  into the OFX installer.

All three surfaces consume the same underlying library. Logic is never
duplicated between them.

### 1.2 What This Is Not

- Not a retraining framework or new model architecture.
- Not a generic multi-backend AI serving system.
- Not a broadly supported cross-platform engine; platform and hardware support
  is curated and explicitly designated. See
  [Support Matrix](../help/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).
- Not a replacement for the original CorridorKey project; it is a focused
  native runtime and integration layer for deployment.

### 1.3 Intended Users

- **Local operators** who want native execution without Python or virtual
  environments.
- **Color graders and compositors** using DaVinci Resolve or Foundry Nuke on
  officially supported hardware.
- **Pipeline integrators** who need a stable CLI or library surface for
  automated workflows.
- **Desktop users** who prefer a graphical interface to the CLI for keying
  and diagnostics tasks.

## 2. Support Philosophy

Hardware and platform support is classified by one of four explicit
designations:

| Designation | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Officially supported** | Validated on this hardware/platform. Releases are tested against it. Bug reports are accepted and prioritized. |
| **Best-effort** | Known to work in most cases, but not systematically validated. Known limitations exist. Bug reports are accepted but not guaranteed to be resolved. |
| **Experimental** | Partially integrated. Known errors exist in practice. Not recommended for production use. Bug reports are accepted for tracking purposes only. |
| **Unsupported** | Not integrated or known to be broken. No bug reports accepted. |

Vague claims such as "works on most hardware" or "compatible with" are not
used. Every hardware path and host version has an explicit designation.

Support is defined by packaged and validated product tracks. A backend present
in the core runtime for probing, diagnostics, or future integration does not
become a support claim unless it is distributed and validated as a product
track.

The complete support table is in [Support Matrix](../help/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).

## 3. Runtime Architecture

### 3.1 Layer Overview

- **Interface layer:** CLI, OFX plugin, and Tauri GUI
- **Application layer:** job orchestration, OFX runtime service, diagnostics
- **Core layer:** inference session management, device detection, frame I/O,
  post-process, and session policies

### 3.2 Execution Tracks

The runtime contains multiple backend hooks, but product support is defined by
curated execution tracks.

The current official product tracks are:

- Apple Silicon via MLX model pack and bridge exports
- Windows RTX via ONNX Runtime TensorRT RTX EP for the green model and a
  dynamic TorchScript path for the blue model on NVIDIA RTX 30 series and
  newer

The current experimental product tracks are:

- Windows DirectML
- Linux RTX via ONNX Runtime CUDA EP on NVIDIA RTX 30 series and newer

Additional provider hooks may exist in the core runtime for diagnostics,
bring-up, or future tracks. Those hooks are not support claims by themselves.

### 3.3 OFX Out-of-Process Runtime

The OFX plugin runs the inference backend in a separate process managed by the
App-layer OFX runtime service. The plugin is a thin IPC client; it does not
load ONNX sessions or GPU backends directly.

This design isolates backend failures, TensorRT RTX compilation errors, and
VRAM exhaustion from the host process (DaVinci Resolve or Foundry Nuke). The
session broker in the service layer pools initialized sessions across multiple
OFX node instances to avoid redundant GPU warmups.

Frame data moves between plugin and service over shared memory. The IPC
protocol is versioned to ensure the plugin and service remain compatible
across incremental updates.

### 3.4 Model Artifacts

Each product track ships curated model artifacts optimized for that track. The
runtime contract - API, parameter schema, and output format - is identical
across tracks. The artifact format and execution provider may differ.

Quality policy is product-defined, not a vendor support claim. The runtime
uses conservative **safe quality ceilings** by backend and available memory to
pick a direct artifact, downgrade automatically, or force an explicit error
when the requested quality is outside the current validated tier.

### 3.4.1 Screen Color Model Variants

CorridorKey ships two model variants distinguished by training plate color:

- **Green** (`corridorkey_fp16_<res>.onnx`): the canonical variant. Officially
  packaged across the full validated resolution ladder for every official
  product track. Served via the canonical ONNX backend on every host.
- **Blue** (`corridorkey_dynamic_blue_fp16.ts`): the dedicated Windows RTX
  variant for blue screen plates. Blue is distributed as one dynamic
  TorchScript artifact instead of a per-resolution ladder. The runtime uses
  the requested quality resolution at execution time and keeps the green ONNX
  ladder unchanged.

The runtime selects the variant by the user-provided screen color parameter.
When the blue pack is not installed or cannot initialize, the runtime applies
the documented green-domain canonicalization fallback rather than substituting
another blue resolution.

### 3.4.2 Model Pack Distribution

Model artifacts are distributed as **selectable packs** rather than a single
mandatory bundle. Each pack is identified by product track and screen color
variant. Packs are hosted on Hugging Face and addressable through the
`download_url` field on every catalog entry.

The installer or first-run flow offers the user a pack selection: green only,
blue only, or both. Selecting fewer packs reduces install footprint without
disabling runtime features beyond the unselected variants. The
`corridorkey doctor` command reports which packs are present, which are
missing, and the canonical Hugging Face source for any missing pack.

Models are data, not executable code. Pack downloads after install do not
invalidate macOS notarization or Windows Authenticode signatures of the
plugin, CLI, or GUI binaries.

### 3.5 Fallback Behavior

Fallback is surface-dependent.

- CLI and tolerant automation workflows may fall back to ONNX CPU execution.
- The OFX plugin favors explicit failure over silent CPU fallback on
  unsupported interactive GPU requests.

Fallback or failure is logged explicitly. The `corridorkey doctor` command
reports the active execution path and any fallback conditions before
processing begins.

## 4. Product Boundaries

### 4.1 Current Scope

- Native inference execution:
  - MLX for the official Apple Silicon track
  - TensorRT RTX EP for the official Windows RTX track on NVIDIA RTX 30 series
    and newer
  - DirectML for the experimental Windows DirectML track
  - CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime for the experimental Linux RTX track
  - ONNX CPU fallback for tolerant workflows
- CLI surface (`corridorkey`) with stable JSON and NDJSON output contracts
- OFX plugin for DaVinci Resolve 20 and Foundry Nuke 17 on Apple Silicon,
  Windows, and Linux
- Tauri desktop GUI distributed as an independent installer that embeds the
  runtime payload
- Green and blue screen color model variants, distributed as independent
  selectable packs
- Alpha hint ingestion and rough-matte fallback generation
- OFX runtime/status reporting for guide source, safe quality ceiling, and the
  actual runtime path used for the last render
- Platform-specific model artifact packaging
- `doctor`, `benchmark`, and `process` commands with structured diagnostics

### 4.1.1 Curated Surface Set

The four officially supported user surfaces are DaVinci Resolve OFX, Foundry
Nuke OFX, the `corridorkey` CLI, and the Tauri desktop GUI. The OFX path is
shared between Resolve and Nuke at the OFX 1.4 contract level. Per-host
adjustments live in dedicated branches that never regress the path the other
host depends on.

These four surfaces form the curated boundary for the current product line.
Other hosts (for example Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects) are not
part of the current scope; see Non-Goals.

### 4.2 Non-Goals

- Training, fine-tuning, or exporting new model architectures
- A generic plugin framework or SDK for third-party extension
- Support for editing hosts beyond DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke as part of
  the current officially supported product line. Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe
  After Effects are out of the current scope and require dedicated host
  integration work that has not been started
- Browser, cloud, or server-side deployment
- Real-time preview at full resolution without hardware acceleration

## 5. Operational Contracts

### 5.1 CLI Output

All commands produce human-readable output by default. Append `--json` to
receive NDJSON event streams. The NDJSON schema is stable across patch
releases and is the integration surface for pipeline automation.

### 5.2 Diagnostic Commands

`corridorkey doctor` reports:

- detected hardware and selected backend
- fallback conditions, if any
- model artifact presence and validity
- platform-specific constraints relevant to the current runtime

### 5.3 Exit Codes

The CLI uses deterministic exit codes. Zero indicates success. Non-zero codes
correspond to specific failure categories documented in the `--help` output.

---

## 6. Performance Constraints

- No Python in any execution path
- No heap allocation in per-frame or per-pixel loops
- All image buffers are 64-byte aligned for SIMD compatibility
- Zero-copy frame passing via `std::span` between processing stages
- TensorRT RTX first-run compilation is expected and takes 10-30 seconds for a
  new GPU and model combination
