# Project Architecture

This document defines the project structure, the purpose of every directory,
and the rules that govern where code lives. It is the single source of truth
for structural decisions. Any deviation must be discussed and approved in a
PR before it happens.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

The project exists to ship CorridorKey inference as a native, distributable,
and integrable runtime for real hardware. The architecture enforces strict
separation between the Core (inference, math, I/O), the Application
(orchestration, host-plugin services, diagnostics), and the Interfaces (CLI,
OFX plugin for DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke, Adobe plugins for After
Effects and Premiere, and Tauri desktop GUI).

**Key Principles:**

1. **Library First.** The engine is the product boundary. CLI, OFX plugin,
   Adobe plugins, and Tauri GUI all consume the same runtime rather than
   reimplementing behavior.
2. **Interface Segregation.** Each surface (CLI, OFX plugin, Adobe plugins,
   Tauri GUI) is a thin client over the App/Core contracts. Business logic
   never lives in an interface layer.
3. **Predictable Operations.** Diagnostics, fallback behavior, and error
   reporting are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts.
4. **Curated Platform Tracks.** The official product tracks are Apple Silicon
   through MLX and Windows RTX through ONNX Runtime TensorRT RTX EP for green
   and the dynamic TorchScript path for blue on NVIDIA RTX 30 series and
   newer. Windows DirectML and Linux RTX (CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime) are
   explicit experimental product tracks. Other provider hooks present in the
   core runtime do not become support claims unless they are packaged and
   validated. See [Support Matrix](help/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).
5. **Shared Runtime, Curated Artifacts.** The runtime contract is stable
   across product tracks. Model artifacts and backend adapters may differ by
   platform when required for predictable performance.

## 2. Structural Layers

### Layer 1: Core (`src/core`, `src/frame_io`, `src/post_process`)

The engine, math, and I/O capabilities.

- **Inference:** Backend adapters and session management for the official MLX,
  TensorRT RTX EP, and dynamic TorchScript product paths, the experimental
  DirectML and Linux CUDA EP tracks, and other internal provider hooks used for
  diagnostics, bring-up, or future packaging work.
- **Hardware:** Device detection and provider selection.
- **Video Pipeline:** FFmpeg integration for direct memory processing.
- **Math:** Color space conversion, despill, despeckle algorithms.
- **Hint Handling:** External hint ingestion and rough-matte fallback
  generation.

Rules:
- Must not depend on CLI, OFX plugin, or App layers.
- Must not print to stdout or stderr; use callbacks or result types.
- Must return rich error types (`Result<T>`).

### Layer 2: Application (`src/app`)

Orchestration of Core capabilities into coherent jobs and services.

- Job definitions and validation.
- Preset management and strategy selection.
- Progress tracking, stage timing, and benchmark reporting.
- Structured diagnostics, capability reports, and model catalogs.
- Host-plugin runtime service: out-of-process session brokering, IPC
  protocol, and session lifecycle management for interactive host plugins.
- Product-track policy: artifact selection, compatibility rules, and support
  behavior shared by CLI, OFX, Adobe plugins, and the Tauri GUI.

### Layer 3: Interfaces (`src/cli`, `src/plugins/ofx`, `src/plugins/adobe`, `src/gui`)

User-facing surfaces. Each is a thin consumer of App/Core contracts.

- **CLI** (`src/cli`): Argument parsing, output formatting, command dispatch.
  Installed by the Windows suite as part of the fixed runtime/CLI core and
  registered on the system `PATH`. Also available in the portable
  Runtime/GUI bundle. Standalone OFX support packages may carry a colocated
  copy beside `CorridorKey.ofx` for host-plugin support, but the CLI surface
  does not depend on installing OFX.
- **OFX Plugin** (`src/plugins/ofx`): OpenFX host integration, render
  callback, and adapter code that communicates with the App-layer host plugin
  runtime service.
  Host-agnostic at the OFX 1.4 contract level; Resolve and Nuke 17 are the
  validated hosts today, with per-host workarounds gated behind explicit
  branches that never regress the path the other host depends on.
- **Adobe Plugins** (`src/plugins/adobe`): Adobe After Effects SDK effect
  integration for After Effects and Premiere. The build emits separate Green
  and Blue `.aex` modules with distinct PiPL/effect identities while sharing
  Adobe SDK entrypoints, host parameter mapping, pixel-format handling, and
  host logging. Shared inference, model selection, diagnostics, runtime policy,
  and frame transport stay in App/Core or shared common infrastructure.
- **Tauri GUI** (`src/gui`): Tauri 2 + React desktop application. Distributed
  as an optional suite component or portable Runtime bundle. It resolves either
  the suite shared runtime root or the side-by-side packaged runtime and does
  not require the OFX bundle to be installed.

## 4. Host Plugin Runtime Architecture

Interactive host plugins use an out-of-process architecture to protect host
applications from backend and VRAM failures.

**Crash Containment.** The runtime service (`host_plugin_runtime_service`) runs in a
separate process. ONNX session failures, VRAM exhaustion, and TensorRT RTX
compilation errors are isolated from DaVinci Resolve, Foundry Nuke, After
Effects, and Premiere.

**Session Residency.** The session broker (`host_plugin_session_broker`) pools
initialized sessions by backend and model. Multiple host plugin instances
share a session pool rather than each triggering a full GPU warmup.

**Frame Transport.** High-bandwidth frames move between the plugin and service
via shared memory (`shared_memory_transport`). The IPC wire protocol
(`host_plugin_runtime_protocol`) is versioned and handles request/reply orchestration.

**Diagnostics Parity.** Fallback details, stage timings, and initialization
logs from the service are surfaced back to the plugin client and are
accessible through the host's log viewer or effect UI.

---

## 5. Engineering Standards

**Public API Surface.** Public headers live exclusively in
`include/corridorkey/`. External library types (`OrtSession`, `Imf::*`,
`AVFrame`, CUDA / NPP / LibTorch types, host-specific OFX types, host-specific
Adobe SDK types) never appear in public headers - they are wrapped in `src/`.

**PIMPL for ABI Stability.** Main classes such as `Engine` use the PIMPL
pattern so implementation details can change without breaking the public ABI.

**Symbol Visibility Hidden by Default.** Symbols are hidden by default; only
the API surface is exported through the `CORRIDORKEY_API` macro.

**Zero-Copy Data Flow.** `std::span` (via the `Image` struct) passes data
between modules without copying. `ImageBuffer` owns allocations. Do not use
`std::vector<float>` for large pixel data.

**SIMD Alignment.** All image buffers are 64-byte aligned for AVX-512 and
NEON compatibility.

**No Exceptions in Host Plugin Surfaces.** All `extern "C"` OFX and Adobe SDK
entry points are wrapped in a top-level `try/catch`. Exceptions are translated
into host status codes or host-visible errors; none may escape to the host.

**No Heap Allocation in Per-Frame Paths.** Per-frame and per-pixel functions
in `src/post_process/` must not allocate. Scratch state is owned by the OFX
instance lifecycle and reused across frames.

**Result-Based Error Handling.** The library uses `std::expected<T, Error>`
throughout. `std::exit` and `abort` are never called from library code.

**No New Top-Level or `src/` Directories Without an Architecture Update.**
Any new top-level directory or `src/` subdirectory must be reflected in this
document in the same change, including its purpose and dependency rules.
