# Project Architecture

This document defines the project structure, the purpose of every directory,
and the rules that govern where code lives. It is the single source of truth
for structural decisions. Any deviation must be discussed and approved in a
PR before it happens.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

The project exists to ship CorridorKey inference as a native, distributable,
and integrable runtime for real hardware. The architecture enforces strict
separation between the Core (inference, math, I/O), the Application
(orchestration, OFX service, diagnostics), and the Interfaces (CLI, OFX
plugin for DaVinci Resolve and Foundry Nuke, and Tauri desktop GUI).

**Key Principles:**

1. **Library First.** The engine is the product boundary. CLI, OFX plugin,
   and Tauri GUI all consume the same runtime rather than reimplementing
   behavior.
2. **Interface Segregation.** Each surface (CLI, OFX plugin, Tauri GUI) is
   a thin client over the App/Core contracts. Business logic never lives in
   an interface layer.
3. **Predictable Operations.** Diagnostics, fallback behavior, and error
   reporting are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts.
4. **Curated Platform Tracks.** The official product tracks are Apple Silicon
   through MLX and Windows RTX through ONNX Runtime TensorRT RTX EP for green
   and the dynamic TorchScript path for blue on NVIDIA RTX 30 series and
   newer. Windows DirectML and Linux RTX (CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime) are
   explicit experimental product tracks. Other provider hooks present in the
   core runtime do not become support claims unless they are packaged and
   validated. See [Support Matrix](help/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).
5. **Shared Runtime, Curated Artifacts.** The runtime contract is stable
   across product tracks. Model artifacts and backend adapters may differ by
   platform when required for predictable performance.

## 2. Structural Layers

### Layer 1: Core (`src/core`, `src/frame_io`, `src/post_process`)

The engine, math, and I/O capabilities.

- **Inference:** Backend adapters and session management for the official MLX,
  TensorRT RTX EP, and dynamic TorchScript product paths, the experimental
  DirectML and Linux CUDA EP tracks, and other internal provider hooks used for
  diagnostics, bring-up, or future packaging work.
- **Hardware:** Device detection and provider selection.
- **Video Pipeline:** FFmpeg integration for direct memory processing.
- **Math:** Color space conversion, despill, despeckle algorithms.
- **Hint Handling:** External hint ingestion and rough-matte fallback
  generation.

Rules:
- Must not depend on CLI, OFX plugin, or App layers.
- Must not print to stdout or stderr; use callbacks or result types.
- Must return rich error types (`Result<T>`).

### Layer 2: Application (`src/app`)

Orchestration of Core capabilities into coherent jobs and services.

- Job definitions and validation.
- Preset management and strategy selection.
- Progress tracking, stage timing, and benchmark reporting.
- Structured diagnostics, capability reports, and model catalogs.
- OFX runtime service: out-of-process session brokering, IPC protocol, and
  session lifecycle management for the OFX plugin.
- Product-track policy: artifact selection, compatibility rules, and support
  behavior shared by CLI, OFX, and the Tauri GUI.

### Layer 3: Interfaces (`src/cli`, `src/plugins/ofx`, `src/gui`)

User-facing surfaces. Each is a thin consumer of App/Core contracts.

- **CLI** (`src/cli`): Argument parsing, output formatting, command dispatch.
  Ships inside the OFX installer alongside `CorridorKey.ofx` and is registered
  on the system `PATH` so it is callable from any terminal after the OFX
  install. Also available standalone in the portable runtime bundle that
  feeds the Tauri GUI installer.
- **OFX Plugin** (`src/plugins/ofx`): OpenFX host integration, render
  callback, runtime client that communicates with the App-layer OFX service.
  Host-agnostic at the OFX 1.4 contract level; Resolve and Nuke 17 are the
  validated hosts today, with per-host workarounds gated behind explicit
  branches that never regress the path the other host depends on.
- **Tauri GUI** (`src/gui`): Tauri 2 + React desktop application. Distributed
  as a separate desktop installer that embeds its own copy of the runtime
  payload (the staged output of `package_windows.ps1`); does not require the
  OFX bundle to be installed.

## 4. OFX Runtime Architecture

The OFX plugin uses an out-of-process architecture to protect the host
application (DaVinci Resolve) from backend and VRAM failures.

**Crash Containment.** The runtime service (`ofx_runtime_service`) runs in a
separate process. ONNX session failures, VRAM exhaustion, and TensorRT RTX
compilation errors are isolated from the host.

**Session Residency.** The session broker (`ofx_session_broker`) pools
initialized sessions by backend and model. Multiple OFX node instances share
a session pool rather than each triggering a full GPU warmup.

**Frame Transport.** High-bandwidth frames move between the plugin and service
via shared memory (`shared_memory_transport`). The IPC wire protocol
(`ofx_runtime_protocol`) is versioned and handles request/reply orchestration.

**Diagnostics Parity.** Fallback details, stage timings, and initialization
logs from the service are surfaced back to the plugin client and are
accessible through the host's log viewer.

---

## 5. Engineering Standards

**Public API Surface.** Public headers live exclusively in
`include/corridorkey/`. External library types (`OrtSession`, `Imf::*`,
`AVFrame`, CUDA / NPP / LibTorch types, host-specific OFX types) never appear
in public headers - they are wrapped in `src/`.

**PIMPL for ABI Stability.** Main classes such as `Engine` use the PIMPL
pattern so implementation details can change without breaking the public ABI.

**Symbol Visibility Hidden by Default.** Symbols are hidden by default; only
the API surface is exported through the `CORRIDORKEY_API` macro.

**Zero-Copy Data Flow.** `std::span` (via the `Image` struct) passes data
between modules without copying. `ImageBuffer` owns allocations. Do not use
`std::vector<float>` for large pixel data.

**SIMD Alignment.** All image buffers are 64-byte aligned for AVX-512 and
NEON compatibility.

**No Exceptions in the OFX Surface.** All `extern "C"` OFX entry points are
wrapped in a top-level `try/catch`. Exceptions are translated into OFX status
codes; none may escape to the host.

**No Heap Allocation in Per-Frame Paths.** Per-frame and per-pixel functions
in `src/post_process/` must not allocate. Scratch state is owned by the OFX
instance lifecycle and reused across frames.

**Result-Based Error Handling.** The library uses `std::expected<T, Error>`
throughout. `std::exit` and `abort` are never called from library code.

**No New Top-Level or `src/` Directories Without an Architecture Update.**
Any new top-level directory or `src/` subdirectory must be reflected in this
document in the same change, including its purpose and dependency rules.
