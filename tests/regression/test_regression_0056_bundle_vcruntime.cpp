// Regression test for Issue #56:
// "Failed to prepare runtime session for ... host plugin runtime server process exited
//  during startup" reported on Foundry Nuke 17.0v2 + Windows + RTX 3090 Ti
//  against v0.8.2-win.2.
//
// The host plugin runtime sidecar imported MSVCP140.dll from Foundry Nuke's install
// directory instead of from %WINDIR%\System32 because Nuke calls
// SetDllDirectory on its own process — Microsoft documents at
// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order
// that this alters the DLL search order INHERITED BY CHILD PROCESSES, placing
// the host install dir ahead of System32. Nuke's older MSVCP140 v14.36 was
// ABI-incompatible with the toolchain TensorRT-RTX / ORT were built against
// (v14.50), and the spawned sidecar crashed at MSVCP140!0x12f58 with
// EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION before reaching wWinMain (verified against the
// Windows Application event log).
//
// The fix is the deployment Microsoft documents at
// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/redistributing-visual-cpp-files
// under "Install individual redistributable files": ship the Visual C++
// Redistributable DLLs app-local in the bundle. CMake's
// InstallRequiredSystemLibraries module discovers the active toolchain's
// redist set and src/plugins/ofx/CMakeLists.txt copies it into the bundle's
// Contents/Win64/. Win32 search-order step #1 ("the folder from which the
// application loaded") is evaluated BEFORE any SetDllDirectory-altered step,
// so the bundled copy wins regardless of host process behavior.
//
// This regression guard asserts the bundle still ships the redist set on
// every Windows build. If a future refactor strips the POST_BUILD copy from
// CMake or drops the InstallRequiredSystemLibraries include from the root
// configuration, this test fails the build before anyone packages a release
// that reproduces #56.
//
// The CMake build wires CORRIDORKEY_OFX_BUNDLE_WIN64_DIR to the staged
// bundle's Contents/Win64 path. The test runs cross-platform (no GPU, no
// host-specific behavior) and is a no-op outside Windows because the
// VC++ Redist concept is Windows-only.
