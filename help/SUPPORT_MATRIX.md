# Support Matrix

This document is the single source of truth for hardware, platform, and host
application support policy. Every hardware path and host version has an
explicit designation. No path is described without one.

**See also:**
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - practical guide for diagnosing
issues on any supported or partially supported path

Support status is defined by packaged and validated product tracks. A backend
enum, probe, or provider hook in the core runtime does not become a support
claim by itself.

---

## Support Designations

| Designation | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Officially supported** | Validated on this configuration. Releases are tested against it. Bug reports are accepted and prioritized. |
| **Best-effort** | Known to work in many cases, but not systematically validated. Known limitations exist. Bug reports are accepted but not guaranteed to be resolved. |
| **Experimental** | Partially integrated. Known errors exist in practice. Not recommended for production use. Bug reports are accepted for tracking purposes only. |
| **Unsupported** | Not integrated as a product track or known to be broken. No bug reports accepted. |

## DaVinci Resolve - Host Version Support

| Resolve Version | OFX Plugin Support |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| DaVinci Resolve 20 | Officially supported |
| DaVinci Resolve 20 on Linux (Studio only) | Experimental |
| DaVinci Resolve 19 | Best-effort |
| DaVinci Resolve 18 | Best-effort - known plugin discovery and loading issues exist; behavior is not equivalent to Resolve 20 |
| DaVinci Resolve 17 and earlier | Unsupported |

Resolve 18 has real plugin discovery and loading issues that have not been
resolved. It must not be treated as equivalent to Resolve 20. If the plugin
does not appear in Resolve 18, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## Foundry Nuke - Host Version Support

| Nuke Version | OFX Plugin Support |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Nuke 17.0v2 (Windows RTX) | Best-effort - validated via headless smoke and manual UAT |
| Nuke 16.x, 15.x, 14.x | Best-effort - shares the OFX 1.4 surface, not systematically validated |
| Nuke 13.x and earlier | Unsupported |

The plugin uses standard OpenFX 1.4 properties and suites that are part of
every modern Nuke release; there are no Nuke-specific code paths in the
render hot path. Help labels and the tutorial button adapt to the active
host based on the `kOfxPropName` string the host advertises.

Cache cleanup on plugin update is handled automatically by the Windows
installer when Nuke is detected. The installer clears
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\nuke\ofxplugincache\ofxplugincache_Nuke<ver>-64.xml`
so the freshly staged bundle is rescanned on the next Nuke launch.

Designation escalates to Officially supported once a licensed-runner
headless smoke (`CORRIDORKEY_RUN_NUKE_E2E=1`) is gating CI and the track
has accumulated a clean run history.

---

## Adobe After Effects and Premiere - Host Version Support

| Adobe Host | Plugin Support |
|------------|----------------|
| After Effects 2025 or newer | Unsupported - packaged implementation target; host render validation is not complete |
| Premiere Pro 2025 or newer | Unsupported - packaged implementation target; host render validation is not complete |
| Earlier After Effects versions | Unsupported |
| Earlier Premiere Pro versions | Unsupported |

Adobe host plugins use the After Effects SDK effect surface. The Premiere path
is validated through the same Adobe effect plugin, with Premiere-specific pixel
format and render-path behavior tested separately before any support
designation can be raised.

Designation escalates only after the Adobe plugin builds through the canonical
pipeline, installs into a MediaCore scan path, renders through the
out-of-process runtime service in both After Effects and Premiere, reopens
saved projects with stable parameters, and closes both hosts without a crash.

---

## macOS - Platform and Hardware Support

| Configuration | Support |
|---------------|---------|
| Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) - macOS 14+ | Officially supported |
| Apple Silicon - macOS 13 | Best-effort |
| Intel Mac | Unsupported |

Apple Silicon is the primary and official macOS path. The MLX backend is used
for inference on all M-series chips. A CoreML path exists in the core runtime,
but it is not the primary product track.

---

## Windows - Platform and Hardware Support

Windows support is defined per backend and hardware family. The platform as a
whole does not have a single designation.

| Hardware | Backend | Support |
|----------|---------|---------|
| NVIDIA Ampere (RTX 30 series) | TensorRT RTX EP | Officially supported |
| NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (RTX 40 series) | TensorRT RTX EP | Officially supported |
| NVIDIA Blackwell (RTX 50 series) | TensorRT RTX EP | Officially supported |
| NVIDIA RTX 20 series (Turing) | TensorRT RTX EP | Experimental - implemented but not validated as an official product path |
| NVIDIA GTX 10xx / 16xx | CUDA via ONNX Runtime | Unsupported - a core CUDA path exists, but no packaged Windows CUDA product track is distributed |
| Intel integrated GPU (DirectX 12) | DirectML | Experimental - implemented and distributed, but not validated as an official product path |
| Intel Arc discrete GPU | DirectML | Experimental - implemented and distributed, but not validated as an official product path |
| AMD GPU | DirectML | Experimental - known errors in practice |
| CPU (AVX2+) | ONNX CPU | Best-effort fallback path for CLI and tolerant workflows |

**RTX 20 series (Turing):** A TensorRT RTX EP path exists in code and may be
usable on some systems, but it is not a validated official Windows support
track. Do not rely on it for production use.

**AMD:** DirectML integration exists but known errors occur in practice.
AMD GPUs are not officially supported. Do not rely on them for production use.

**Windows product tracks:** The canonical public Windows release emits the
official `Windows RTX` installer by default. The `DirectML` installer is
experimental and should only be published intentionally. Other
execution-provider hooks present in the core runtime, such as CUDA, WinML, and
OpenVINO, are not current product support tracks unless they are explicitly
packaged and validated.

**Windows RTX installer policy:**
- `Windows RTX` is the official Windows installer for NVIDIA RTX 30 series and
  newer. It packages the complete green FP16 ONNX ladder through `2048px` and
  the optional dynamic blue TorchScript pack. INT8 ONNX and CPU rendering have
  been retired from the official Windows RTX installer.
- In `Auto`, `Windows RTX` respects the current safe quality ceiling for the
  detected VRAM tier.
- In fixed modes, `Windows RTX` can attempt a packaged quality above the safe
  ceiling and then follows the established runtime failure or fallback path if
  that quality cannot execute.
- `Windows RTX` installs to a single OFX bundle location. Reinstalling the
  same track replaces the previous Windows RTX package in place.
- The current public Windows RTX quality ladder in the OFX plugin is
  `Draft (512)`, `High (1024)`, `Ultra (1536)`, and `Maximum (2048)`.
  The historical `768px` rung remains reference-only and is not part of the
  public OFX quality UI.

The `corridorkey doctor` command reports the active backend and any fallback
conditions on your specific hardware before processing begins.

---

## Linux - Platform and Hardware Support

Linux support is an experimental product track. It packages the same FP16
model ladder shipped by the Windows RTX track, but switches the inference
backend to the ONNX Runtime CUDA Execution Provider via a curated Microsoft
prebuilt (`onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu`). The TensorRT RTX Execution Provider is
not yet built for Linux and is tracked for a future release.

| Hardware | Backend | Support |
|----------|---------|---------|
| NVIDIA Ampere (RTX 30 series) | CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime | Experimental |
| NVIDIA Ada Lovelace (RTX 40 series) | CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime | Experimental |
| NVIDIA Blackwell (RTX 50 series) | CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime | Experimental |
| NVIDIA RTX 20 series (Turing) | CUDA EP via ONNX Runtime | Experimental |
| AMD GPU | none | Unsupported - no ROCm product track is packaged |
| Intel GPU | none | Unsupported - no OneAPI product track is packaged |
| CPU (AVX2+) | ONNX CPU | Best-effort fallback path for CLI and tolerant workflows |

Linux packaging emits three artifacts from the same validated bundle:

- `CorridorKey_OFX_vX.Y.Z_Linux_RTX.tar.gz` - universal portable archive
  with `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` helpers.
- `CorridorKey_OFX_vX.Y.Z_Linux_RTX.deb` - Debian package for Ubuntu
  22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- `CorridorKey_OFX_vX.Y.Z_Linux_RTX.rpm` - RPM package for Rocky Linux 9
  and RHEL 9.

All three wrappers install the same bundle at
`/usr/OFX/Plugins/CorridorKey.ofx.bundle/` and register `corridorkey` on the
system `PATH` through `/usr/local/bin/corridorkey`.

**NVIDIA driver requirement:** Linux installs require a proprietary NVIDIA
driver of version 555 or newer. The CUDA Toolkit itself does not need to be
installed on the host; the packaged runtime ships the CUDA user-mode runtime
libraries next to the plugin binaries.

**CI coverage gap:** Linux builds run on hosted Ubuntu runners without GPU
access. GPU-side validation is not currently covered by automated CI. This is
the primary reason the Linux track is designated Experimental.

## OS Version Requirements

| OS | Minimum Version |
|----|----------------|
| macOS | 14.0 (Sonoma) for official support; 13.x for best-effort |
| Windows | Windows 11 for officially supported paths |
| Windows 10 | Best-effort - not systematically tested |
| Rocky Linux / RHEL | 9.x - Experimental (matches Blackmagic Design's own Resolve Studio 20 host target) |
| Ubuntu LTS | 22.04 and 24.04 - Experimental |
| Other Linux distributions | Unsupported - builds may work via the `.tar.gz` archive but are not validated |

---

## Surface Support Scope

The CLI, OFX plugin, Adobe plugins, and Tauri GUI share the same execution
backends and hardware support designations above. Host plugins additionally
depend on the host application support defined in the host version tables
above.

The CLI does not have a host application dependency and can be used
independently of any NLE.

CPU rendering has been retired. The OFX plugin, Adobe plugins, and CLI all
require a supported GPU (NVIDIA RTX 30 series or newer on Windows; Apple
Silicon with MLX on macOS). Requesting `Backend::CPU` no longer resolves to a
packaged artifact and surfaces a "no supported render backend" failure rather
than falling back to a quality the renderer cannot ship.

---

## Tauri Desktop GUI Support Scope

The Tauri desktop GUI is distributed as an optional Windows suite component
that uses the shared CLI/runtime core installed by the suite. It does not
require an OFX host and does not require the OFX bundle to be present on the
system. The portable Runtime/GUI bundle remains available for support and
minimal installs.

The GUI inherits the same backend and hardware support designations as the
OFX plugin and CLI on the same machine. A configuration officially supported
for the OFX plugin is officially supported for the GUI; experimental tracks
remain experimental in the GUI.

---

## Host Application Coverage

The current officially supported host applications are DaVinci Resolve and
Foundry Nuke through the OFX plugin. After Effects and Premiere are packaged
Adobe plugin implementation targets, but their support designation remains
Unsupported until the Adobe host validation gates pass. The CLI is a
host-independent surface. The Tauri GUI is an additional host-independent
surface.

Other editing applications are not currently supported and require their own
SDK integrations.

---

## Screen Color Model Variants

The runtime ships two model variants distinguished by the screen color the
model was trained on. Green is distributed as a per-resolution ladder. Blue on
Windows RTX is distributed as one dynamic artifact that accepts the runtime
quality resolution.

### Green model variant

The canonical CorridorKey model, trained on green screen plates.

| Resolution | TensorRT RTX EP | MLX (Apple Silicon) | Status |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| 512px | Validated | Validated | Officially supported |
| 1024px | Validated | Validated | Officially supported |
| 1536px | Validated | Validated | Officially supported |
| 2048px | Validated | Validated | Officially supported |

Green packs are part of every official Windows RTX and macOS Apple Silicon
installer.

### Blue model variant

A dedicated CorridorKey variant trained on blue screen plates. On Windows RTX,
blue uses a dynamic TorchScript artifact instead of the green ONNX TensorRT RTX
EP ladder. This keeps blue independent from per-resolution engine files while
preserving the existing green optimized path.

#### Windows RTX coverage

| Resolution | Backend | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 512px | Dynamic TorchScript | Officially supported through the blue dynamic pack |
| 1024px | Dynamic TorchScript | Officially supported through the blue dynamic pack |
| 1536px | Dynamic TorchScript | Officially supported through the blue dynamic pack |
| 2048px | Dynamic TorchScript | Officially supported through the blue dynamic pack |

#### macOS Apple Silicon coverage

| Resolution | Backend | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 512px | MLX (canonicalization through green) | Officially supported |
| 1024px | MLX (canonicalization through green) | Officially supported |
| 1536px | MLX (canonicalization through green) | Officially supported |
| 2048px | MLX (canonicalization through green) | Officially supported |

There is no dedicated blue MLX artifact today. On Apple Silicon, blue plates
are handled by canonicalizing the input into the green domain, running the
green MLX model, and restoring the result. This is automatic and reported in
`corridorkey doctor`.

#### Missing artifact UX

When the dynamic blue pack is not installed or cannot initialize, the runtime
reports the blue artifact condition through diagnostics and applies the
green-domain canonicalization fallback. The fallback uses the green model at
the requested quality path; it does not substitute a lower blue resolution.

### Pack distribution

Model packs are selectable. The installer or first-run flow lets the user
choose green only, blue only, or both. Packs not selected at install time can
be added later through the same flow. Missing packs surface as missing
artifacts in `corridorkey doctor`, with the canonical Hugging Face download
location attached.
